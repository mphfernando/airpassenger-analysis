## 📌 Project Objectives

* Explore and visualize the air passenger dataset
* Test for stationarity and apply necessary transformations
* Fit ARIMA and SARIMA models
* Forecast future passenger traffic
* Evaluate model performance using statistical metrics

## 📊 Dataset Description

* **Features**:

  * `Month`: Time (monthly from 1949 to 1960)
  * `#Passengers`: Number of air passengers

This dataset is a classic benchmark for seasonal time series forecasting.

## 🧠 Models Used

* **ARIMA** – Captures trend and autoregressive components
* **SARIMA** – Extends ARIMA to model seasonality

### 📈 Evaluation Metrics

* **MAE** – Mean Absolute Error
* **RMSE** – Root Mean Squared Error
* **R² Score** – Coefficient of Determination
